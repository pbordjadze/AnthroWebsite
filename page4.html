        </h2>
        <div class="bux-listicle__text">As humans expanded across the globe, they encountered other hominin species such as Neanderthals and Denisovans. These interactions likely involved cultural exchange, sharing of technologies, and possibly interbreeding.</div>

        </h2>
        <div class="bux-listicle__text">Genetic studies have revealed evidence of interbreeding between modern humans and other hominin groups. This genetic admixture contributed to the genetic diversity of modern human populations and influenced traits such as immune response and susceptibility to diseases.</div>

          <span class="bux-listicle__title-text">Cultural Diffusion</span>
        </h2>
        <div class="bux-listicle__text">Hominin interactions facilitated the spread of cultural practices, technologies, and behaviors. For example, the migration of modern humans out of Africa disseminated innovations such as toolmaking techniques, symbolic art, and language to different regions of the world.</div>
