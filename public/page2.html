        </h2>
        <div class="bux-listicle__text">Early hominins were likely opportunistic omnivores, consuming a varied diet that included fruits, vegetables, nuts, insects, and occasional meat scavenged from kills made by other predators. This diverse diet provided essential nutrients for brain development.</div>

        </h2>
        <div class="bux-listicle__text">The transition to a diet higher in fat and protein, particularly with the incorporation of animal meat, allowed early humans to support larger brains. This dietary shift coincided with advancements in tool use and social organization, contributing to the emergence of modern human cognition.</div>
